This repository contains my data science projects while completing the University of Virginia Master's of Data Science program.

- COVID_Federal_Spending.zip

This was the final project for our "Programming and Systems for Data Science" graduate course. The goal was to pull data sets from five different sources to identify relationships between COVID cases, Health & Human Services (HHS) spending, and state governor political affiliation. The project gives users an option to analyze a subset of the 50 states or all states simultaneously. 

The raw data are stored as CSV files in the rawData folder. During the data cleaning portion of the Python script, we write the cleaned data sets as CSV files and save them in the tidyData folder. 

The projectBuild_master.ipynb is the main Python script for the project. The test_ProjectBuild_master.ipynb is the unit testing script for the main script.


- MiniProject_seattlePetLicenses.ipynb

This was a mini project from our "Foundations of Computer Science" graduate course. The goal of the project was to create a database from a Kaggle data set and query the database using SQLite to find trends in the data.
